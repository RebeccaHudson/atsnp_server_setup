What's this document for?
  Setting up the Virtual Machine for atsnp search from square one.

Prerequisites:
   The virtual machine must be accessible to your user, 
   You will need to be 'sudo' on the VM to set things up. 

A. Install a bunch of stuff
   python, wsgi, pip, django, etc. (nginx if it's not there)
   sudo yum install
   DROP CONTENT HERE.

B. Make a directory for my code: 
   /var/www/atsnp-rh/
   cd into that directory 

C. Pull the code from these places.
   ssh keys will be needed to push?
   #Ensure that this can work for users who are not me.
     ss_search_viewer 
     rsss_api

D. Setup the nginx configuration. 
   (this should appear from nowhere when the server is started correctly) 
   socket file -> wsgi should eventually put the correct permissions on it.

   D0. how to do stuff to nginx:  
       tail the nginx log file:  sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log       
       restart nginx:            sudo systemctl restart nginx
        
   D1. config files for nginx.
       There is a config file in this repo here: 
          nginx_config/nginx.conf
       copy/adapt it to this location: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

   D2. Setup config files for project, nginx will use these:
       'the project dir' == /var/www/atsnp-rh/ss_search_viewer
       1. Find the uwsgi_params file, and, if it's not already present, 
          put it into the project dir.
          the uwsgi_params file is located at:
             viewer_config/uwsgi_params

       2. Find the .ini file, and if it's not already present, 
          put it into the project directory.
          the ini file is located at:
             viewer_config/ss_search_viewer_uwsgi.ini

       3. Find the file (in this repo) viewer_config/ss_search_viewer_nginx.conf 
          Paste this file into the project directory 
 
       4. Create a symlink from the file ss_search_viewer_nginx.conf to the sites-enabled directory.
          (This step makes the nginx configuration file accessible.)
          sudo ln -s  /var/www/atsnp-rh/ss_search_viewer/ss_search_viewer_nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled 

E. Setup the 



    4. Try to start up the server agian.
       (sudo systemctl restart nginx)
